"# dot-leader " 


This project aims to help anyone with a implementation of a dot leader. 

A dot leader is the filling dots of a line that separate two categories that align at the edges of a line, usually items and their prices price

The ideas come from this link https://www.w3.org/Style/Examples/007/leaders.en.html
